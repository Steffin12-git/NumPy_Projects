# NumPy Projects for Learning

This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring **NumPy**, the powerful numerical computing library in Python. It contains various projects and datasets designed to help understand the practical use of NumPy in real-world data analysis, simulations, and manipulation tasks.

## What's Included

* Beginner to advanced level NumPy projects
* Real-world inspired datasets (e.g., health data, sales data)
* Hands-on coding examples with explanations
* Data cleaning, processing, and numerical operations using NumPy
* Integration with Pandas and Matplotlib for deeper analysis and visualization

## Goals

* Build a strong foundation in NumPy
* Learn vectorized operations, broadcasting, indexing, and more
* Develop real-world datasets from scratch using NumPy
* Solve practical data problems using efficient NumPy techniques
